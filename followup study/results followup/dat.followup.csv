Improve lighting and security measures: Adequate lighting and security measures can help deter crime and make people feel safer. Addison could invest in improvements to street lighting, install surveillance cameras, and increase patrols in high-crime areas.

There should also be incentives for any resident who reports any criminal activities they witness and create awareness with various forms of advertisements around Addison. Local businesses should also assist in reducing crime by hiring security guards where the crime is prevalent as well. Creating awareness for needed donations to the city should also help with hiring more police officers and purchasing cameras to place all over the city. Signs should be posted that make potential criminals aware that they are being recorded as well. Residents should also get free home security systems in the worst areas and having guns for their defense should be suggested along with offering them free gun safety classes. There should also be a shooting range that offers free lessons on using a firearm for self-defense.

Addison needs to take a multi-pronged approach to reducing crime. The first step should be to increase the presence of law enforcement in the city, making sure that all areas are adequately patrolled and that any suspicious activity is reported and investigated. Additionally, the city should invest in crime prevention programs, such as neighborhood watch groups, and work with the community to build relationships between citizens and law enforcement. Finally, the city should focus on providing opportunities for those at risk of committing crimes, such as job training, education, and mental health services. By taking a comprehensive approach to reducing crime, Addison can make its neighborhoods safer for all residents.","5","Republican"
